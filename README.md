## Overview

This repository is for my internship project within the JetBrains Research AI Agents team. The focus of the project is on developing the cloud infrastructure for LLM-based Agentsâ€”autonomous systems powered by large language models (LLMs) that interact dynamically with their environment. These Agents are designed for various purposes, with one prominent example being a **Debugging Agent** capable of setting breakpoints, analyzing errors, and autonomously implementing fixes within JetBrains IDEs.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this internship is to improve the infrastructure supporting the deployment, scalability, and reliability of LLM-based Agents in the cloud. My responsibilities will involve working on an internal service that hosts and integrates these Agents into JetBrains products.

Key areas of development:

1. **Enhanced Logging Capabilities**
   - Improve the logging mechanisms for better visibility of requests and runtime data. This enhancement will support more efficient debugging and development workflows.

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Increase reliability by implementing robust error-handling mechanisms. The goal is to prevent session termination from single failures, which may involve manual handling or leveraging LLMs to recover gracefully.

3. **Multi-Agent Support**
   - Extend infrastructure to support multi-agent systems, allowing multiple task-specific Agents to communicate and collaborate within a shared environment.

## Flexibility in Development Direction

The project allows flexibility in choosing specific areas to focus on, depending on my interests and learning goals. The project scope may evolve based on the team's needs and real-time challenges encountered during the internship.

## Getting Started

To begin working on this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the required dependencies (instructions in the `requirements.txt`).
3. Review existing documentation to understand current infrastructure and Agent capabilities.
